# Mining pool owners on the other hand may not want to adopt the block pruning option at all. Granted, with 550 blocks of history, it should be possible to validate newly mined blocks on the network without too much trouble. However, it might be in their best interest to keep the blockchain stored in its entirety as a failsafe as well.
#
# With the recent issue surrounding invalid Bitcoin block validation, 550 blocks is not exactly a major buffer to prevent a potential Bitcoin fork. And if the majority of mining pools end up on on a fork of the network for a lengthy period of time, all hell will break loose. Granted, that issue affecting invalid block confirmations has been rectified in a swift manner, but invalid blocks were being generated at an alarming rate for a lengthy period of time.
#
# Companies providing a Bitcoin service are a different matter entirely. Any financial platforms should stick to the full blockchain at all times, no matter what. Other companies, such as the ones providing API access for example, can use block pruning to their advantage, while keeping a copy of the entire blockchain running simultaneously to see which option can handle the userâ€™s requests better.
